# VMtranslator
Implement the Translator for the Virtual Machine language for the Hack architecture, using c.

This is the solution to project 7 and half project 8 of the nand to tetris course.

This is a stack based virtual machine that targets .vm files (byte code) and translates them into .asm (assembly code).
